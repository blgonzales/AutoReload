## Hard reload every time (bypass cache on auto refresh)

Reload tabs like Ctrl+Shift+R, so each automatic refresh fetches a fresh copy instead of a cached one. It is off by default. Turn it on in Settings by ticking **Bypass cache when reloading (hard reload)**; it applies to every tab and takes effect on the next reload.

Useful when a page is served with long cache lifetimes and a normal auto refresh would keep showing the old version: status pages, monitoring dashboards, CI build pages, live scores, or a page you are developing and want to keep fresh. It makes no difference for pages that are never cached. No extra permissions are needed.
